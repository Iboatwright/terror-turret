# The Terror Turret

This is an FGCU Computer Networking course project from Fall 2018.

It is a remotely controlled airsoft turret with a camera on it that is controlled from an 
Android phone remotely over the internet. Be afraid.

Extensive project documentation can be provided upon request.

We had much bigger plans for the project initially, including facial tracking and auto-targeting,
but senior year gets busy other things ended up taking priority. Perhaps one day we will have the
change to add these things.
